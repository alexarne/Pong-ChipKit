## Features

The user can initially choose to play as singleplayer or multiplayer, or view the saved highscores.

In singleplayer, the user chooses difficulty of the AI which controls the other paddle:
* EASY: The user's paddle is infinitely wide, impossible to lose, and the AI's paddle follows the ball with a delay of 20 game updates.
* NORMAL: AI's paddle follows the ball with a delay of 10 game updates.
* HARD: Once in its half of the playing field, the AI predicts where to move in order to correctly block the ball.
* IMPOSSIBLE: The AI predicts where to move in order to correctly block the ball.

In multiplayer, two sets of buttons are given to each player. 

Highscore displays the highscores for each of the singleplayer difficulties, is still saved despite the device being powered off.

In-game, the ball bounces differently depending on where it hits the paddle. The in-game timer is achieved by utilizing the hardware timer and interrupts.

If the user scores a highscore, they may input their name and save their highscore. The name is limited to 6 characters but can be less since it trims excessive spaces.
